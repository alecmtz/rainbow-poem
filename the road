This is a poem about rainbows and how I am finally trying to step
UP
and learn
I used to be so into all of this
but I went into a different road 
not a bad one
but I am back
now we need to keep testing this and lets go
taking it to the first branch
lets take it ahead of main
t
e
s
t
hello
to the 3rd branch
whatever is added should reflect on the main???
to the 2nd branch
lets merge it to main i guess
we are in the main branch
again we are in main lets see if whatever is added underneth should come from branch 3
