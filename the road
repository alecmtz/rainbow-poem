This is a poem about rainbows and how I am finally trying to step
UP
and learn
I used to be so into all of this
but I went into a different road 
not a bad one
but I am back
now we need to keep testing this and lets go
to the 3rd branch
whatever is added should reflect on the main???
to the 2nd branch
lets merge it to main i guess
we are in the main branch
again we are in main lets see if whatever is added underneth should come from branch 3
DOING MORE AND MORE ON THE 3RD BRANCH
